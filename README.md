# COBOL68 Mainframe Projects
This repository is dedicated to exploring and learning COBOL 68 within a simulated IBM mainframe environment. It serves as a practical learning path, leveraging the MVS-TK5 distribution and the Hyperion Hercules emulator to provide a hands-on experience with classic IBM architecture.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this repository is to offer a tangible learning experience with COBOL 68. While COBOL 68 is an older version and not actively updated, it provides a unique opportunity to understand the foundational aspects of IBM mainframe architecture and its operational nuances.

## Environment Details

### MVS-TK5
The core of this learning environment is MVS-TK5. This distribution includes COBOL 68, offering a historical snapshot of mainframe development. It's an excellent resource for sensing the "life" of IBM's architectural past.

### Hyperion Hercules
Instead of the Hercules emulator bundled with MVS-TK5, this project utilizes Hyperion Hercules. This choice was made due to compatibility issues with an older MacBook Air (mid-2012) running Xubuntu. Hyperion Hercules provides the necessary stability and features for a smooth emulation experience on this specific setup.

**Hyperion Hercules Version:**

### Learning Path
This repository will contain various COBOL 68 programs, JCL (Job Control Language) scripts, and documentation to guide learners through different aspects of mainframe programming. Topics may include:

- Basic COBOL program structure
- File I/O operations
- Data manipulation
- JCL for program execution
- Interacting with the MVS operating system

### Getting Started
1. Install Hyperion Hercules: Ensure you have the specified version of Hyperion Hercules installed and configured on your system.
2. Obtain MVS-TK5: Follow the instructions to acquire and set up the MVS-TK5 distribution.
3. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cobol68-mainframe-projects.git
    cd cobol68-mainframe-projects
    ```
5. Explore the projects: Navigate through the directories to find COBOL programs and JCL examples.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have COBOL 68 programs, JCL examples, or improvements to the documentation, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
