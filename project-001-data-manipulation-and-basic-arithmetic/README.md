# Project 1: Data Manipulation and Basic Arithmetic

## Objective:
Reinforce COBOL data types, basic arithmetic operations, and data movement.

## Tasks:
- Create a COBOL program that defines various data types (PIC X, 9, S9V99).
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numeric data.
- Use MOVE statements to transfer data between different fields.
- Display results with appropriate formatting.

## Expected Output: 
Formatted display of arithmetic results.
