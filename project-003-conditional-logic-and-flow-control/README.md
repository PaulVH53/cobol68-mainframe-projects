Project 3: Conditional Logic and Control Flow

Objective: Introduce IF/ELSE statements, EVALUATE, and basic looping (PERFORM).

Tasks:
Create a program that accepts user input (via JCL PARM or simple hardcoding for now).
Use IF/ELSE to check conditions (e.g., if a number is positive, negative, or zero).
Implement an EVALUATE statement for multiple choice scenarios.
Use PERFORM VARYING or PERFORM UNTIL for a simple loop (e.g., print numbers 1 to 10).
Expected Output: Conditional messages and a simple numbered list.
