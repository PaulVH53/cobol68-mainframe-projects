# Project 4: Introduction to Files - Sequential File Processing (Input)

## Objective: 
Learn to read data from a sequential dataset.

## Tasks:
- Create a simple sequential data file (e.g., using TSO EDIT or a REXX script to build it) with a few records (e.g., names and ages).
- Write a COBOL program to define the FD (File Description) and record layout for this file.
- Use OPEN INPUT, READ, and CLOSE statements to process the file.
- Display each record read.
- JCL Focus: DD statement for INPUT file.

## Expected Output: 
Display of each record from the input file.
