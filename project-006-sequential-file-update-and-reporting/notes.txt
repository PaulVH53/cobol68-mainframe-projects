We'll follow these steps:

Create the Input Transaction Data File.

Create the COBOL Program (PROJ6.COB).

Create the JCL for Compilation, Link-Edit, and Execution.

Step 1: Create the Input Transaction Data File
You'll create a simple sequential data file named HERC01.PROJ6.TRANS. Each record will contain:

ITEM-CODE: 10 characters (alphanumeric)

QUANTITY: 5 digits (numeric)

PRICE: 5 digits, 2 decimal places (numeric)

So, each record will be 10 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 22 characters long.
